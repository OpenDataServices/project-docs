# Software Development Board

The Software Development board is used to reflect the state of the work to interested parties. This might include colleagues both inside and outside of Open Data Services. 

Trello is very flexible, and so this page describes the conventions that we use to help reduce the learning overhead of working on a new project. 

### Columns

The board has columns to reflect each stage of the software development process in the [Delivery stage](../project-lifecycle-1/delivery-stage.md). 

Each column should have a card at the top with a blue cover and a quick description of what each stage means

### Stickers

Stickers can be used to quickly, visually group related pieces of work. For example, work that relates to a particular area of the system, or that meets particular user stories. Stickers might align with those used on other boards, to ease co-ordination. 

A common convention is to use the yellow star sticker to identify work in the Ideas & Reports column that should be refined next. 

### Labels

Labels are used to denote which workflow applies to a particular card. A board might contain work that has different rules, and labels allow for quick filtering. 

### Covers

Covers are used to identify if work is blocked \(red cover\) or impeded \(yellow cover\). A blue cover is used for board documentation. 

### Cards

Cards should point to everything that relates to a particular piece of work, but contain only 

### Trello Power-Ups

#### GitHub

The GitHub power-up allow GitHub issues and Trello cards to be linked. When an issue is added to a card, Trello automatically comments on the issue with a link to the card, so that a 2-way link is established

#### README

The README power-up allows the [Project Delivery Lead](../roles/project-delivery-lead.md) to display a message to board users, and provide some documentation for the board. It can be set to show every time, or only when new information is added. 

#### Butler

Butler automates common actions, reducing the manual work required to administer a board. Common uses include:

* Automatically adding the [Definition of Ready](../patterns-for-collaboration/definition-of-ready.md) template to new cards
