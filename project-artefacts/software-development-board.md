# Software Development Board

The Software Development board is used to reflect the state of the work to interested parties. This might include colleagues both inside and outside of Open Data Services.

Trello is very flexible, and so this page describes the conventions that we use to help reduce the learning overhead of working on a new project.

## Columns

The board has columns to reflect each stage of the software development process in the [Delivery stage](../project-lifecycle-1/delivery-stage.md). Each column should have a card at the top with a blue cover and a quick description of what each stage means.

Additional columns may be added if the project calls for a specific workflow. It can be helpful to have a separate Done column for each month or each sprint to aid with reporting.

In addition, the board has a couple of extra columns for context:

### Board Constants

Any template cards, summaries of sprint outcomes, links to other boards \(eg [Knowledge Management](knowledge-management-board.md)\), links to system architecture, rationale for the work can live here so that they're always to hand.

### High-level Objectives

A copy of appropriate parts of the contract wording to help us ensure that we're always keeping what we're being paid for in mind!

## Stickers

Stickers can be used to quickly, visually group related pieces of work. For example, work that relates to a particular area of the system, or that meets particular user stories. Stickers might align with those used on other boards, to ease co-ordination.

A common convention is to use the yellow star sticker to identify work in the Ideas & Reports column that should be refined next.

## Labels

Labels are used to denote which workflow applies to a particular card. A board might contain work that has different rules, and labels allow for quick filtering.

## Covers

Covers are used to identify if work is blocked \(red cover\) or impeded \(yellow cover\). A blue cover is used for board documentation.

## Cards

Cards should point to everything that relates to a particular piece of work, but contain only notes and discussion that relate to doing the work.

## Trello Power-Ups

### GitHub

The GitHub power-up allow GitHub issues and Trello cards to be linked. When an issue is added to a card, Trello automatically comments on the issue with a link to the card, so that a 2-way link is established. This power-up should be used whenever a project is version-controlled on GitHub.

### README

The README power-up allows the [Project Delivery Lead](../roles/project-delivery-lead.md) to display a message to board users, and provide some documentation for the board. It can be set to show every time, or only when new information is added.

### Butler

Butler automates common actions, reducing the manual work required to administer a board. Common uses include:

* Automatically adding the [Definition of Ready](../patterns-for-collaboration/definition-of-ready.md) template to new cards

### Card Family

Card Family allows sub-cards to be linked back to a parent card when a task is subdivided

### Card Numbers

Card Numbers adds numbers to the front of each card to aid with identification of individual cards
