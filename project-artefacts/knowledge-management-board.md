# Knowledge Management Board

The knowledge management board is a place where our collective knowledge about a project can be shared, so that everyone can access it. When a project comes to an end, it's a useful artefact for the client to reflect on what we needed to record, and if there's future projects in the same domain, it's a useful part of onboarding. 

The columns that are required will vary, but suggested columns are:

### Links

A card per resource, with a simple link in the body. Use to share links to important documents, code, repos, apps, and people. 

### Contract / Commercial

Notes on the contractual arrangements, such as billing

### Emails

Copy/pasted text of emails, or extracts from emails, to link back to when referring to conversations

### Terminology

A card per term, so that concepts are unambiguously described across the project. A lot of our projects use terms like "feed", "item", "data" and so ensuring that they're defined in the scope of the project aids communication. 

### Quality / Performance / Spec

Notes on specific points relating to what we're doing, but that span multiple areas of work. For example, system characteristics \("must take less than 1 second to first byte"\), or hosting arrangements for a project.
