# Running the board

To "run the board" is to go through each item on the [Software Development Board](../project-artefacts/software-development-board.md) : right-to-left, top-to-bottom.

Running the board ensures that every item gets looked at, and reviewed. 

We start on the right-hand side \(typically this is the Done column\) and review each item in turn. Whoever worked on it presents the work, and briefs the team on how it went. 

Then, we look at the In Progress column. For each item, whoever's working on it next presents where it's up to, any impediments, and what's happening next. 

Then, we look at the Ready column. The [Product Lead](../roles/product-lead.md) describes each item, and why it's important.
