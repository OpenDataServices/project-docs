# Definition of Done

The Definition of Done is a description of when a piece of work can be considered to be done. It's intended to:

* Allow developers to move on completely from a piece of work
* Ideas that people have get captured and recorded
* Prevent little bits of extra work adding up
* Ensure that work actually gets finished!

The DoD can be adapted for specific projects, but only if the project's specific requirements require additional steps \(e.g. a specific sign-off procedure\). 

### Template Definition of Done

Work is Done when:

* Any ideas, problems or things that need investigation are recorded in GitHub issues and/or Trello cards as appropriate
* There's appropriate documentation
* It's deployed / live / merged / in use, or a deploy is scheduled
* We've told everyone who might have an interest in it
* If it's a change that required approval / sign-off / a final review by someone at the client before we move on, that's been done. 

#### Rationale

When developing software it's really easy to focus on the interesting and/or hard parts of the job - working out how to solve the problem, and making the code work. However, this means it's easy to leave the finishing-off parts un-done, or mean to get back to them later. Having a comprehensive Definition Of Done means that once work is finished, you don't have to think about it ever again!
