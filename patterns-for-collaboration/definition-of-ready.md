# Definition of Ready

The Definition of Ready \(DoR\) ensures that we know what we're trying to do, and when we'll be able to call it done, before we start work.

The DoR can be adapted to meet specific project requirements, such as where there's a specific approval process. Be aware, however, that using a non-standard DoR adds to the overhead for someone coming on to the project, or people working on multiple projects. 

### Template Definition of Ready

* It's clear how the world will be different when the work is completed
* It's clear what will and won't be done
* Any uncertainty, assumptions, dependencies or constraints are recorded
* There's an order-of-magnitude estimate of how long it will take
* The work's been approved by someone at the client
* There's links to everything that's written down about the work - such as plan.io tickets, GitHub issues

#### Example

_\* It's clear how the world will be different when the work is completed_

A Data Tool user will be able to upload a file with widgets, and will see meaningful feedback on how good their widget game is.

_\* It's clear what will and won't be done_

We will:

* Design a simple interface to present the widgets back to the user
* Check the for validity against the widgets schema
* Catch the validation errors and write some copy that's specific to widgets
* Give some thought to edge cases, and see what we can do to make sure that even quite broken widgets are handled well

_\* Any uncertainty, assumptions, dependencies or constraints are recorded_

We're not sure what edge cases we might come across, or how reliably we can identify widgets

Copy might take a while to write

We don't really know what mistakes people are likely to make yet - we'll make some educated guesses

_\* There's an order-of-magnitude estimate of how long it will take_

Days

_\* The work's been approved by someone at 360_
