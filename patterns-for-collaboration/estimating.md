# Estimating

Sometimes, it's helpful to think through how long something might take; creating an estimate makes you work out what you need to do, what the steps might be, what you need to figure out, and so on. 

We use 'order of magnitude' estimating; this allows sufficient accuracy to be useful while being imprecise enough to convey that estimates will never be exact. 

Accuracy = "how likely the estimate is to be correct". For example "the time spent was within the estimated range 90% of the time" would be a 90% accuracy rate.

Precision = "the range of values embodied by a given value". For example "1 minute" suggests a precision of approximately +/- 15s. 

An order of magnitude estimate uses units of time, but discards the value. For example, a piece of work might take "hours" or "days". The bands are overlapping, and that's ok. This gives a very high accuracy, but fairly low precision. The precision is usually sufficient for an intuitive check of a budget or schedule. 

#### Rationale

Estimates are useful to work out if a budget of time or money is ever going to be sufficient for a project, but people are really bad at absolute estimating. They're much better at relative estimating, but relative estimates need to go through the extra step of being resolved into absolute terms before they can be used for specific tasks. 

Order-of-magnitude estimating is still based on the real world passage of time, but at a sufficiently low-precision level to avoid inappropriate use of the data \(eg by adding up the numbers to arrive at a total cost\).
