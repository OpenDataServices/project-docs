# Project Lifecycle

A project typically follows a fairly standard path through the organisation:

## Pre-bid

A project at the pre-bid stage will often have an estimated budget range, an outcome to be achieved, and some broad ideas about what should be done.

At this stage, the [Project Delivery Lead](../roles/project-delivery-lead.md) might:

* Give estimates of when the work might be carried out, given the current forecast, and pencil in time
* Set up documentation of the project, such as a Knowledge Management board or a shared doc
* Enter the estimated budget into the co-op forecast

The [Technical Lead](../roles/technical-lead.md) might:

* Evaluate the viability of the proposal
* Suggest implementation options that fit within the budget
* Discuss trade-offs, quality expectations and alternative options

The [Product Lead ](../roles/product-lead.md)might:

* Discuss how the proposed project will be used, and by whom
* Suggest alternative ways to approach the project's aims
* Develop an understanding of the other products and services that the project might interact with
* Develop and document an understanding of the ecosystem that the project will operate within

## Bid stage / Negotiation stage

At the negotiation stage, we work to agree with a client broadly what we'll do, and specify in a contract details such as timescales, budget, and interaction with other parties.

At this stage, the [Project Delivery Lead](../roles/project-delivery-lead.md) might:

* Confirm the team and the timescales in the forecast
* Set up the financial aspects of the contract
* Set up the project delivery artefacts such as a Trello board, plan.io project and calls
* Hold initial talks with proposed subcontractors

The [Technical Lead](../roles/technical-lead.md) might:

* Ensure that the software development that we agree to is clearly understood
* Consult with colleagues to understand any previous work that might be relevant
* Research frameworks, libraries and other external work that we can re-use 

The [Product Lead ](../roles/product-lead.md)might:

* Work to ensure that there's a shared understanding of the project
* Discuss with colleagues who might be best placed to carry out both the development and non-development aspects of the project
* Ensure that the wider product or service that we're creating is clearly understood

## [Delivery Stage](delivery-stage.md)

At the delivery stage, we're actually doing the project.

At this stage, the [Project Delivery Lead](../roles/project-delivery-lead.md) might:

* Ensure that impediments to the delivery of the project are identified and addressed quickly
* Monitor the progress of the work against the initial aims to ensure that it continues to progress, and alert the team to any issues
* Schedule regular calls around the delivery period for the team to discuss the work to be done
* Schedule regular calls with stakeholders to ensure that everyone's kept informed
* Send invoices 
* Track time spent and time remaining

The [Technical Lead](../roles/technical-lead.md) might:

* Choose technologies
* Find or deliver training to team members who aren't so familiar with those technologies 
* Create and maintain software and system architecture documentation 
* Ensure that all software development work is properly recorded in appropriate systems
* Recommend techniques and practices for team members to work together
* Write technical documentation 

The [Product Lead ](../roles/product-lead.md)might:

* Co-ordinate the development and non-development aspects of the work towards the overall project goal
* Create and maintain an ordered backlog of work items that meet the Definition Of Ready
* Review work against the Definition of Done and accept it
* Meet with the client to discuss prioritisation and definition of work as the work progresses
* Co-ordinate user research
* Write user documentation

## Ending Stage

At the ending stage, we've delivered the project and we need to make sure that we leave everything in a good state

At this stage, the [Project Delivery Lead](../roles/project-delivery-lead.md) might:

* Send final invoices
* Convene retrospectives
* Close any projects, hand over any resources

The [Technical Lead](../roles/technical-lead.md) might:

* Ensure that all bugs and identified future improvements are written up in GH issues 
* Carry out handover of software, systems and servers to other parties
* Shut down any development resources used 

The [Product Lead ](../roles/product-lead.md)might:

* Evaluate the work with the client
* Record any ideas for future development 
* Ensure that any non-development work is aligned with the development work that's been carried out
