# Delivery Stage

The delivery stage is where we actually do the project. 

Typically, this will comprise:

* Some early work
* One or more focussed periods of development with a larger team
* Some followup work

The nature and balance of each of these will depend on the project. 

All work that anyone does on the project should be reflected on the [Software Development Board](../project-artefacts/software-development-board.md).

The workflow for the delivery stage is on [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kpMhQ80=/) , and reproduced here:
