# project-docs

These docs describe how we do software-centric project management at ODSC. They're intended to standardise our practice, reduce the mental overhead of understanding our processes, and give us an artefact to reflect on and refine as we improve our practice.

In general, these processes will be most applicable to mid-sized projects - more than "a few days' work" but lasting less than a year.

The principles, however, are universally applicable, and should influence the design of larger and smaller projects.

These docs can be found at [https://robredpath.gitbook.io/project-management-at-odsc/](https://opendataservices-1.gitbook.io/project-management-at-odsc/)
