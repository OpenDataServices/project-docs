# project-docs

These docs describe how we do dev project management at ODSC. They're intended to standardise our practice, reduce the mental overhead of understanding our processes, and give us an artefact to reflect on and refine as we improve our practice. 

In general, these processes will be most applicable to mid-sized projects - more than "a few days' work" but lasting less than a year. 

The principles, however, are universally applicable.
