# On Leadership

Because we're a co-op, all leadership is by consent and to the benefit of the team. When someone leads on a particular area, they're relieving the team of the need to make decisions about that aspect of the work by group decision-making, and in some cases are able to bring their unique skills, experience and relationships to the task. 

Leading on an area of work does mean:

* Consulting with others
* Making decisions 
* Being responsible for sharing the decisions made, and the rationale for them, in an appropriate way

Leading on area of work doesn't mean:

* Being solely responsible for the decision
* Being held responsible for others' work
* Hiding information

On some projects, some roles can be combined, depending on the particular needs of the project. 

Roles can be carried out by different people over time. For example, the [Project Delivery Lead](project-delivery-lead.md) who provides input at the bid stage may not be available to carry a project forward, and so could hand that role on.
